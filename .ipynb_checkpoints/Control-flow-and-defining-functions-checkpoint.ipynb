    "## 1. `if` Statement Block\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement is the most basic control flow in Python. It allows you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "Here is what it looks like in its most basic form.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code block to run if the condition is True\n",
    "\n",
    "# start a new block of code without the indentation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this block, we would replace `condition` with whatever our condition is. We need to keep the `:`. Then, on the next line, we indent and write our code block. Note that in many other programming languages, we would follow this with `end` or `endfif` on the last line to tell the programming language that we have completed the `if` code block. **In Python this is handled by the indent itself.** So, to end the code block, we simply start writing on a new line that is not indented.\n",
