    "## Best Practices for Importing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, importing packages like `numpy` is currently essential for mathematical and scientific computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to follow best practices for importing and using packages efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Standard Importing\n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy` is commonly imported with an alias (`np`) to simplify function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import `numpy` or its submodules or functions with the following approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np # RECOMMENDED. accesses all of numpy's submodules and functions. call these functions with np.[submodule/function]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This convention (`np`) is widely used and makes your code cleaner and easier to read, especially for others who may be familiar with `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Selective Importing\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numpy import array, dot # import only specific functions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only need specific functions from `numpy`, import them directly to reduce namespace pollution. This can also make your code more efficient in some cases. The problem is that it requires you to be familiar with the submodules and functions in `numpy`, which we are still learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Avoid import *\n",
    "\n",
    "While importing everything using `import *` might seem convenient, it can clutter the namespace and lead to conflicts with other libraries or functions. It’s also less clear which functions come from `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numpy import * # NOT RECOMMENDED. this accesses all of numpy's submodules and functions, but the functions and submodules could potentially overwrite other loaded submodules and function\n",
    "```\n",
    "This practice makes your code harder to debug and understand and is **NOT RECOMMENDED.**"
